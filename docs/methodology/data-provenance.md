# Ourea — data provenance

## Purpose

This document separates:
- official source data;
- derived spatial fields;
- planning proxies;
- development assumptions.

The purpose is to prevent accidental over-claiming in the demo/deck.

## 1. City-scale screen

### Official Medellín/DANE population projections

Source workbook:
`https://www.medellin.gov.co/es/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/5.-Proyecciones-poblacionales-a-nivel-Barrios-y-Veredas-Medellin-2018-%E2%80%93-2030.xlsx`

Ourea uses 2026 total population by urban barrio.

Parsed:
- 249 official urban barrio records;
- total projected urban population in those records: 2,256,465;
- 248 safely matched to current polygon export;
- unmatched: Nueva Villa de La Iguaná, population 2,374.

Audit:
`data/derived/city_population_2026_barrio_match.csv`

### Official 2023 IMCV / AMPI-AMPI

Source:
`https://www.medellin.gov.co/es/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/socializacionIMCV2023.xlsx`

Ourea uses comuna/corregimiento-level AMPI-AMPI as a relative socioeconomic quality-of-life measure.

Important:
- it is **not barrio-level**;
- every barrio in one comuna inherits the same socioeconomic component in the city screen.

### Official barrio / mass-movement hazard geometry

The working city polygons and official mass-movement hazard export were assembled during the Medellín GIS research workflow.

Ourea calculates high/medium hazard coverage by barrio and combines that static coverage with the official projected population.

### Derived city-screen fields

- `population_2026`
- `imcv_ampi_2023`
- `hazard_weighted_population_proxy_2026`
- `exposure_component`
- `vulnerability_component`
- `priority_exposure`
- `priority_balanced`
- `priority_equity`
- corresponding ranks.

Method:
`docs/methodology/city-screen.md`

## 2. Detailed terrain

Official Medellín 2024 municipal DEM ImageServer:
`https://www.medellin.gov.co/servidormapas/rest/services/ServiciosImagen/Modelo_digital_de_elevacion_medellin_2024/ImageServer`

Working raster:
- EPSG 9377;
- ~1 m pixel size;
- detailed sandbox crop converted to local Terrain-RGB tiles.

Use:
- 3D terrain;
- elevation;
- local slope.

Limitation:
terrain is not a soil/geotechnical model.

## 3. Buildings

Official Medellín construction geometry service:
`https://www.medellin.gov.co/servidormapas/rest/services/vivienda_ciudad_terri/VA_ConsultaOperadorCatastral_geo/MapServer/14`

Working detailed source originally contained 5,835 unique valid geometries.

Competition sandbox contains 1,588 building geometries.

Fields include:
- official/cadastral construction attributes;
- assigned official hazard category;
- sampled terrain elevation/slope;
- socioeconomic stratum;
- DANE population/household planning proxies;
- planning-cell ID;
- display height.

`height_m = floors × 3 m` is a display approximation, not surveyed building height.

## 4. Detailed mass-movement hazard

Official Medellín hazard polygons.

Building assignment uses a conservative maximum intersected hazard category:

`Alta > Media > Baja`

This is a spatial hazard classification, not a probability.

## 5. Detailed access network

Official Medellín road/pedestrian/service-access network:
`https://www.medellin.gov.co/servidormapas/rest/services/transporte/VM_Transporte/MapServer/0`

Use:
- displayed access network;
- cell-level mapped corridor length;
- access decision proxy.

Limitation:
not traffic flow, travel time, evacuation or road failure simulation.

## 6. Socioeconomic stratum

Official Medellín spatial stratum/manzana information assembled during the research workflow.

Use:
- building-level planning equity proxy;
- stratum-1 share per planning cell.

Limitation:
stratum is not household income and should not be described as one.

## 7. DANE detailed population proxy

DANE 2018 census-block source:
`https://geoportal.dane.gov.co/mparcgis/rest/services/MGN2018/Serv_CapaManzanaInt_2018/MapServer/0`

Detailed sandbox block totals were allocated to buildings by constructed-area share.

Use:
- population-weighted planning exposure.

Limitation:
not current household-level population.

## 8. Planning cells

Ourea uses ~80 m derived planning cells in the detailed sandbox.

They are a decision discretization, not:
- administrative boundaries;
- engineering project boundaries;
- property parcels.

## 9. Intervention opportunity proxies

### RWH
Based primarily on roof-area opportunity.

### Drainage
Based on mapped access-corridor opportunity.

Explicitly **not drainage capacity**.

### Restoration
Based on open-space/slope opportunity.

Not a vegetation/geotechnical suitability survey.

## 10. Historical rainfall

Current status:
**pending official SIATA raw station response**.

No synthetic historical rainfall timeline is shipped.

When received, the pipeline will preserve missing data and calculate:
- increment;
- 1 h;
- 6 h;
- 24 h;
- 3 d;
- 7 d;
- 15 d accumulations;
- coverage fields.

See `docs/methodology/siata-calibration.md`.

## 11. Cost evidence

Current optimizer unit:
**planning credits, not COP**.

Ourea cost evidence includes:
- local RWH technical specifications;
- local RWH budget components;
- 2023 Santa Elena official procurement ceiling equivalent to ~COP 2.119M / installed 1,000 L system;
- local Comuna 8 mitigation/bioengineering project budgets;
- current Medellín hydraulic/risk project scale references.

The evidence is intentionally not collapsed into one false cross-intervention COP unit cost.
